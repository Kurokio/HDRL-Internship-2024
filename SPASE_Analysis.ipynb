    "# SPASE Record Analysis <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to convert desired SPASE record fields into a SQLite database. The desired fields correspond to metadata extracted from XML files using ElementTree. The tutorial I used to implement ElementTree is [here](https://realpython.com/python-xml-parser/). If more context is needed for the SQLite code than is provided by the comments, I recommend visiting [this link](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/). This project aims to aid in analyzing FAIR for the SPASE records in the NumericalData and DisplayData categories.\n",
